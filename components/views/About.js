<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Bitcorns are 100 pixelated profile pictures inscribed as data on the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcorns
  are among the first ever inscriptions on bitcoin, inscribed in the 39k-47k range. As of today,
  there are over 45 million inscriptions on the bitcoin blockchain. The cheapest Bitcorn on the
  market today is for sale for .032 bitcoin, or approximately $1,300 USD.
</p>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We believe that Bitcoin and Ordinals should (and can) be fun and profitable while fostering a
  strong community where holders help one another instead of creating a PvP environment.</p>
  <p>
    We aim to achieve fun through creating funny, engaging content as well as producing sporadic,
    meaningful Ordinals collections and community events.  We believe that remaining active daily
    in the community, providing value, and treating people with respect and dignity is the best way
    to build a strong community. While cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile market, one of our
    primary goals is to generate sustainable revenue for the project in order to provide the best
    opportunity for our holders to be profitable by investing in our project.
