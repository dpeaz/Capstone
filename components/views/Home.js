<h1>Bitcorns</h1>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We believe that Bitcoin and Ordinals should (and can) be fun and profitable while fostering a
  strong community where holders help one another instead of creating a PvP environment.</p>
  <p>
    We aim to achieve fun through creating funny, engaging content as well as producing sporadic,
    meaningful Ordinals collections and community events.  We believe that remaining active daily
    in the community, providing value, and treating people with respect and dignity is the best way
    to build a strong community. While cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile market, one of our
    primary goals is to generate sustainable revenue for the project in order to provide the best
    opportunity for our holders to be profitable by investing in our project.
